Skills increased, knowledge improved, awareness raised of new technologies!
All going well

### Phase 3 - July & August

Train peer volunteers
The next group of classes start on 6th August.

Reducing numbers has drastically improved people's experience within the classes.  More one-to-one tuition has seen a great improvement in people's understanding of the concept.  People have reported that concentrated time with a tutor has made a great difference in their learning experience.

Although people quite readily help each other in the classes, the training of peer volunteers seems to be taking a little longer than we had originally anticipated.  Tying people down to taking on the role of volunteer within the IT setting seems a bit daunting for people.


### Phase 4 - September & October

Deliver 2 digital skills courses

Train peer volunteers

### Phase 5 - November & December

Deliver final digital skills courses 

## Evaluation

This is where the project lead will share information about what was achieved and what was learned.

### Outputs and outcomes

Overall this project X, Y, Z.

In terms of outputs we delivered A, B and C.

In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has P, Q and R. We know this because J, K and L.

### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

1. One to one tuition
2. Keeping the class all focused on the same piece of equipment
3. Keeping the classes short - concentration time improved

Things that we would do differently next time:

1. Make the classes smaller
2. Make one class per piece of equipment ie.specifically Ipads or E-mail
